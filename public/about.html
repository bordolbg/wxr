            <p class="about-p">vWXR was created by Brody Carty in an attempt to have the ability to emulate weather with flight simulators.
                The website is created for everyone, however more options are available for VATSIM members including a planning feature.
                Briefs, while created by VATSIM facilities, can be used for flying anywhere.

                <br>
                The planning tool allows virtual air traffic controllers to view their airspace with a weather radar.
                A forecast option is available and allows for estimates on where the aircraft will be where the forecast is.
                <br>
                <br>
                vWXR may have bugs and issues. Please report all of these bugs to main@bordy.us or Brody Carty on Discord.
